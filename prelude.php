By engaging in discussion and brainstorming reforms, we can keep up with the trends and lead the other institutes to do the same.

                    <p>The objective of this three-day leadership summit is to bridge the gap between the UG and the PG students in our institutes. We intend to put forward the concerns of the students to the Ministry of Education to include the highest authorities in the thick of things
