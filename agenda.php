                    REVIVAL OF CLUTURE AMONG IITIANS (PRE-COVID IIT LIFE)

                    It is quite evident that after the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, it is challenging to return to the world as it was before. Therefore, putting efforts in the right direction to revive the lost offline experiences is crucial. Even though the virtual world has its advantages, we can't deny the importance of classroom teaching, peer interactions, and senior-junior involvement. This lack of hands-on experience has deteriorated the social aspect of our lives.

                        B. Tech. students have a lot to learn, from their academics to general career advice – and a right mentor can indeed make or break their student life. A research scholar can very well guide their junior B. Tech. students, being more experienced and used to the college system.

                        We've seen a major movement in engineering students' interests over the previous few decades, from core to SDE and non-core positions. Despite being a fascinating and insightful area, the core industry is short on competent workforce due to dwindling youth demand for possibilities. This could be attributed to various reasons like - students' lack of awareness about opportunities in core fields, less salary packages, lack of facilities and incentives as compared to software engineers.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The necessity of the hour is to elevate and promote the benefits of the core industry, as well as the opportunities that exist inside it. We need to reclaim our place in the core industry by changing students' and hiring employers' perspectives and strengthening our “Make in India” policy. As a result, the main focus of this summit will be on the following points:
