                            The leadership summit aims to shed light on the challenges
                            students face due to the rapidly changing socio-educational
                            frameworks and put forward resolutions that would help the
                            students excel in the face of this colossal paradigm shift. By
                            engaging in discussion and brainstorming reforms, we can keep up
                            with the trends and lead the other institutes to do the same.

                            ministry since it is our duty, as one of the premier institutes
                            of the nation, to benefit every individual that faces the same
                            challenge.

                        It is quite evident that after the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, it is challenging to return to the world as it was before. Therefore, putting efforts in the right direction to revive the lost offline experiences is crucial. Even though the virtual world has its advantages, we can't deny the importance of classroom teaching, peer interactions, and senior-junior involvement. This lack of hands-on experience has deteriorated the social aspect of our lives.

                            We've seen a major movement in engineering students' interests over the previous few decades, from core to SDE and non-core positions. Despite being a fascinating and insightful area, the core industry is short on competent workforce due to dwindling youth demand for possibilities. This could be attributed to various reasons like - students' lack of awareness about opportunities in core fields, less salary packages, lack of facilities and incentives as compared to software engineers.
